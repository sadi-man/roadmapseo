As someone who has always been interested in technology and coding, I recently stumbled upon a couple of helpful resources for those looking to become software engineers or web developers. As businesses continue to expand their presence online, these professions have seen a surge in demand and opportunity.

My Software Engineer Roadmap
----------------------------

One helpful resource I found was a roadmap created by SheCanCode that lays out the steps individuals can take to become a successful software engineer. The image below, sourced from their website, visually organizes the different aspects of software engineering, such as coding languages, database management, and software architecture.

### Instructions:

1. Begin by learning the basics of programming languages, whether it be through online courses or textbooks. This step is crucial as it sets a solid foundation for future development.
2. Practice, practice, practice. The more hands-on experience you gain, the better equipped you'll be to tackle real-world coding projects.
3. Expand your knowledge by studying different coding languages and understanding how they work together in software development.
4. Gain experience working with databases and algorithms to better understand how they impact software design.
5. Focus on developing strong communication and teamwork skills, as software engineering often requires collaboration on large-scale projects.
6. Continue to learn and stay up-to-date on new technology and programming advancements
